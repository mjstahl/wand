open Wand

(* Two properties of the evaluator, kept together because one pays for the
   other.

   A wand tail call is an OCaml tail call: a function whose body ends in a
   call to itself runs in a stack that does not grow. That used to be untrue
   for a reason that had nothing to do with calls -- every `Located` node
   installed an exception handler to stamp a position onto an error passing
   through it, and a handler is a frame that stays. A `Located` sits on
   every function body and every match arm, so the stack grew with the call
   chain, and since a minor collection rescans the whole stack as roots, a
   long recursion cost time quadratic in its own depth.

   The position now travels in a cell rather than in a handler, which is
   what makes the tail call a tail call. That trades an exact mechanism for
   a maintained one: a handler could not report the wrong position, whereas
   a cell can if anything that carries on after a subexpression forgets to
   put back what it found. So the second half of this file pins the position
   a runtime error is reported at, in the shapes where forgetting would
   show. *)

(* A call with work waiting on it keeps a frame, so nesting them without end

   exception Stack overflow" -- which cannot be caught here: a handler that
   matches it, even one whose guard rejects it, hangs rather than unwinds,
   because the guard runs on the stack that just ran out. So the depth is
   bounded before the stack goes, and the reader gets an error instead.

   The bound is read from the environment, which is what lets these run in
   a hundredth of a second rather than the half-minute the real ceiling
   takes to reach. *)
